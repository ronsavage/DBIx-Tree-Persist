Comments= <<EOT
- Add dbh as an optional parameter to new(). If not supplied, use the config file to get
DBI connect options. This makes testing easier, too. Document new parameter.
- Add option data_structure to output a structure which can be turned into JSON.
This uses the new method build_structure().
- Make pretty-printing the tree a stand-alone method: pretty_print().
- Add Tree::DAG_Node::Persist to See Also.
- Add README file.
- Patch usage of File::Temp in t/test.t for BSD-based systems (EXLOCK => 0). This is part of
making the code look much more like t/test.t as shipped with Test::DAG_Node::Persist.
- Adopt DBIx::Admin::CreateTable for t/test.t.
