1.04  Thu Nov  8 12:38:00 2012
	- No code changes.
	- For pre-reqs such as strict, warnings, etc, which ship with Perl, set the version # to 0.
		Reported as RT#80663 by Father Chrysostomos for Tree::DAG_Node.

1.03  Web Feb 16 11:53:00 2011
	- Replace /usr/bin/perl with /usr/bin/env perl.
	- Replace common::sense with use strict and use warnings, to get uninit var warnings.
	- Clean up tests to stop uninit warnings.

1.02  Tue Nov 16 15:59:00 2010
	- Switch from FindBin::Real to FindBin (which is in core).

1.01  Thu Oct  7 10:09:00 2010
	  - Add dbh as an optional parameter to new(). If not supplied, use the config file to get
	  	DBI connect options. This makes testing easier, too. Document new parameter.
	  - Add option data_structure to output a structure which can be turned into JSON.
	  	This uses the new method build_structure().
	  - Make pretty-printing the tree a stand-alone method: pretty_print().
	  - Add Tree::DAG_Node::Persist to See Also.
	  - Add README file.
	  - Patch usage of File::Temp in t/test.t for BSD-based systems (EXLOCK => 0). This is part of
	  	making the code look much more like t/test.t as shipped with Test::DAG_Node::Persist.
	  - Adopt DBIx::Admin::CreateTable for t/test.t.

1.00  Tue Sep 21  9:14:00 2010
