=head1 NAME

DBIx::Tree::Persist - Play with Tree and Tree::Persist a la DBIx::Tree

=head1 Synopsis

First, edit lib/DBIx/Tree/Persist/.htdbix.tree.persist.conf.

Then run the scripts in this order (see scripts/test.sh):

=over 4

=item scripts/drop.tables.pl

Drop tables one and two.

Of course, you only run this after running create.tables.pl.

=item scripts/create.tables.pl

Create tables one and two.

Some notes regarding the ways tables one and two are declared (in C<DBIx::Tree::Persist::Create>):

=over 4

=item Null 'v' Not Null

parent_id is not 'not null', because L<Tree::Persist> stores a null as the parent of the root.

=item Foreign Keys

If parent_id is 'references two(id)', then it cannot be set to 0 for the root, because id 0 does not exist.

However, by omitting 'references two(id)', the parent_id of the root can be (manually) set to 0, and
L<Tree::Persist> still reads in the tree properly.

=back

=item scripts/populate.tables.pl

Populate table two from the text file data/two.txt.

The data comes from the docs for L<DBIx::Tree>.

populate.tables.pl uses neither L<Tree> nor L<Tree::Persist>.

The code in C<DBIx::Tree::Persist::Create> uses 0 as the parent_id of the root, whereas L<Tree::Persist> uses null.

This is both to demonstrate the point made above that L<Tree::Persist> handles this, and to adhere to my convention
to use 'not null' whenever possible. Clearly, this is not possible when it's L<Tree::Persist> writing to the
database. Hence table two which I write can use 'not null', but table one can't use it, since table one is
populated by L<Tree::Persist>.

This convention is adopted from:

	Joe Celko's SQL for Smarties 2nd edition
	Morgan Kaufmann
	1-55860-576-2
	Section 6.9, page 120, Design Advice for NULLs

=item scripts/report.tables.pl

Report the record counts from tables one and two.

=item scripts/tree.pl -t two -v

Traverse and print table two.

This run uses L<Tree::Persist>, and L<Tree>.

=item scripts/tree.pl -t two -c one

Copy table two to table one.

This run uses L<Tree::Persist>, and L<Tree>.

=item scripts/tree.pl -t two -c one

Copy table two to table one, again. Table one now contains 2 independent trees.

=item scripts/tree.pl -t one -s 1 -v

Traverse and print table one, starting from id = 1.

=item scripts/tree.pl -t one -s 21 -v

Traverse and print table one, starting from id = 21.

The tree structures for the 2 trees printed by the last 2 commands will be the same.
However, since the trees are stored at different offsets within table one, the ids
associated with each corresponding node will be different.

=item scripts/tree.pl -t one -d -s 1 -v

Use the -data_structure option to call the C<build_structure()> method, and to output
that structure instead of pretty-printing the tree.

=back

=head1 Description

L<DBIx::Tree::Persist> provides sample code for playing with Tree and Tree::Persist a la DBIx::Tree.

=head1 Distributions

This module is available as a Unix-style distro (*.tgz).

See L<http://savage.net.au/Perl-modules/html/installing-a-module.html> for
help on unpacking and installing distros.

=head1 Method: build_structure($root)

Returns a Perl data structure which can be turned into JSON.

The -data_structure option to scripts/tree.pl gives you access to this feature.

=head1 Method: copy_table()

If copy_name is used to pass a table name to new(), sub run() calls sub copy_table().

If copy_name is not used, sub run() calls sub traverse().

sub copy_table() shows how to build a tree based on a linear scan of a dataset.

=head1 Method: new()

See scripts/tree.pl for how to pass sample parameters to new() via a command-line program.

C<new()> takes a hash of parameters:

=over 4

=item copy_name => 'A table name'

copy_name is optional.

If specified, the code copies the data from the table named with the -t option
to the table named with the -c option.

=item dbh => $dbh

dbh is optional.

If specified, the code uses the $dbh provided.

If not specified, the code reads the config file lib/DBIx/Tree/Persist/.htdbix.tree.persist.conf
to get parameters and calls DBI -> connect() to generate a dbh.

This is mainly used for testing. See t/test.t.

=item starting_id => N

starting_id is optional.

If specified, a tree is read from the table named with the -t option, starting at the
id given here.

If not specified, starting_id defaults to 1.

=item table_name => 'A table name'

table_name is mandatory.

The table named with the -t option is always used as input.

It will (probably) have been populated with scripts/populate.tables.pl.

=item verbose => N

verbose is optional.

If specified and > 0, if provides more progress reports.

If not specified, it defaults to 0, which minimizes output.

=back

=head1 Method: pretty_print($root)

Print the tree nicely. This method is called from C<traverse()> if the -data_structure option
is not used.

=head1 Method: run()

After calling new(...), you have to call run(). See scripts/tree.pl for sample code.

=head1 Method: traverse()

If copy_name is used to pass a table name to new(), sub run() calls sub copy_table().

If copy_name is not used, sub run() calls sub traverse().

sub traverse() shows how to build a tree from a disk file, and to then process that tree.

if the -data_structure option (to scripts/tree.pl) is used, the tree is converted to a data structure,
which is then printed using the C<Dumper()> method of L<Data::Dumper::Concise>.

If the -data_structure option is not used, the tree is pretty-printed by calling the method C<pretty_print()>.
